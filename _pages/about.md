I am a third year doctoral student at the [Center of Mathematical Economics](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/zwe/imw/) at Bielefeld University under the supervision of [Prof. Max Nendel](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/profiles/max-nendel) and [Prof. Frank Riedel](https://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/friedel/english.html).

My work is part of the [Collaborative Research Center 1283](https://www.sfb1283.uni-bielefeld.de/) Project C7 'Markovian dynamics under model uncertainty'.

My research interests are in viscosity theory and non-linear semigroups.
