I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Luiss Guido Carli](https://www.luiss.it/) with [Prof. Fausto Gozzi](https://docenti.luiss.it/gozzi/) and third year Doctoral Student at the [Center of Mathematical Economics](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/zwe/imw/) at Bielefeld University under the supervision of [Prof. Max Nendel](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/profiles/max-nendel) and [Prof. Frank Riedel](https://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/friedel/english.html).

My research interests are in viscosity theory and non-linear semigroups and their applications to optimal control.
