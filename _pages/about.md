I am a second year doctoral student at the [Center of Mathematical Economics](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/zwe/imw/) at Bielefeld University under the supervision of [Prof. Max Nendel](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/zwe/imw/members/researchers/nendel/).

My work is part of the [CRC 1283](https://www.sfb1283.uni-bielefeld.de/) Project C7 'Markovian dynamics under model uncertainty'.

My research interests are in viscosity theory and its applications to optimal control.
